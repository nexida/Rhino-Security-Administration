Before building the project, you need to download and copy the ExtJs files. 
The UI of this software has been built using ExtJS (see http://www.sencha.com/products/js/). For licencing reasons (ExtJS is distributed under LGPL v3) the source code of ExtJS cannot be included here. 
So, in order to correctly run the application, you must:
 a) download ExtJS from http://www.sencha.com/products/js/
 b) copy it under '.\src\Rhino.Security.Mgmt\ext'.


When ExtJs is ready, in order to build this project, you need to execute the psake build script from the PowerShell console.

You do this using the following command from the root project directory:

	.\psake.ps1 default.ps1 -framework 4.0
	
You may need to allow script execution by running the following command as administrator:

	Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted
	
Also note that the build script assume that you have git.exe on your path.
