Rhino Security Administration
==============

'Rhino Security Administration' is a simple implementation of an administration UI for *[Rhino Security](http://github.com/ayende/rhino-security)* using *[ExtJS](http://www.sencha.com/products/js/)* and ASP.NET MVC. 

It currently only supports:
 * managing users, groups and their associations
 * managing operations (add and search)
 * managing permissions for users\groups on given operations

It was built using *[NEXiDA code generation tools](http://www.nexida.com/smartui)*.

Some part of UI are following *[this](http://rhino-tools-dev.googlegroups.com/attach/0a63df296482c47c/perms.png?gda=NXWCCEQAAABqEPH6mMNzHk0-ymvumASkwZlVSLQQdkej8l5jUshxg-MF-emFP98VnK4EbMWjMWFV6u9SiETdg0Q2ffAyHU-dzc4BZkLnSFWX59nr5BxGqA&view=1&part=4)* mock up.
